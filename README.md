For my Information System Management module project, I concentrated on the intricacies of e-commerce, with a specific emphasis on George W. Reynold's seminal work on the 9 critical factors in e-commerce. eBay served as an exemplary case study, allowing for a detailed exploration of these factors within a real-world context. In this report, I shed light on eBay's operational efficacy and also offer valuable lessons and best practices for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce.
